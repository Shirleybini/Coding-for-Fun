Start with an integer n. 

If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. 

Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1.

For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:

22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

In the example, the cycle length of 22 is 16.
